Welcome to the Baldrick Application Framework.

While the libraries are fully functional and reliable, the distribution
and packaging is still primitive.

Quick Guide to Installation:

- Choose a location for the perl libraries, which are under 
  lib/Baldrick in the distribution.  Move the "lib/Baldrick" directory 
  to the appropriate location - this could be in a "lib" directory within
  your cgi-bin directory, or /usr/local/lib/perl5/site_perl/x.x.x/.
  The perl modules must remain in a directory called "Baldrick", which
  should be within your general "lib" directory.

- install "baldrick-stub" in your CGI directory, renaming it to 
  "baldrick-stub".

- edit the "use lib" statement in baldrick-stub if your installation directory
  for the libraries is anything other than "lib/Baldrick" or a "Baldrick"
  directory within the @LIB search path.

- run "./baldrick-stub".  Install any missing libraries it complains about,
  such as Template, Time::HiRes, etc.

- In cgi-bin directory, make symlinks to baldrick-stub for whatever 
  program names you want to invoke it as - "shop", "forum", "signup", etc.
        ln -s baldrick-stub shop
        ln -s baldrick-stub forum       ...etc.
  (Every Baldrick application has the same loader, the stub; it then looks
  up URLs in the config file to decide how to handle each request.)

- Create a config file as "etc/baldrick.cfg". See 
      http://www.baldrickframework.org/book/Baldrick.cfg 
  for format and examples.

- In the config file, edit PathMap to associate URLs with Modules (handlers).
