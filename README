The Baldrick Application Framework is a free and open-source library
of Perl 5 modules to provide the functionality common to all
non-trivial web applications: session management, URL-to-handler
mapping, user loading, authentication and authorization, database
connectivity and querying, and template-based output generation.

Baldrick is a set of libraries, not an application. It is a tool
for programmers to use in building their own web applications (called
Modules in a Baldrick setup).

Baldrick has been used to build a shopping cart, a membership-tracking
application, and a message board. It could serve equally well as
the foundation for a blog, a shared calendar application, a photo
upload site, or any other web application that needs the features
described above.

Baldrick is designed to allow Modules of functionality - message
board, blog, etc. - to coexist within a single Site (an installation
sharing a master config file, session manager and user login setup).
Users on a site should be able to freely move between installed
modules without re-authenticating, even if those modules were from
different developers.

As of October 2007, it is ready for production use. Documentation
is still very lacking, but I am willing to assist in any installation.

The Baldrick Application Framework may be freely distributed, used,
and modified, under terms of the GNU Public License or the Perl
Artistic License.

The name Baldrick is inspired by the BBC Television series BlackAdder.
No challenge to or dilution of BBC trademarks is intended; the name
was chosen as a tribute to their fine work.
